# ft_linear_regression

A 42 project

The aim of this project is to introduce you to the basic concept behind machine learning.
For this project, you will have to create a program that predicts the price of a car by
using a `linear function` train with a `gradient descent algorithm`.

> The use of pythonâ€™s numpy.polyfit (or any other library such as scipy) is considered cheating.

$$J(a, b) = \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^m (f(x_i) - y_i)^2$$
